# About

This project was made multiple times with less and less help from this [tutorial](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) until this repo was created. The goal was not to use the tutorial (or call it the Rust Book) as well as the internet to create this project, which was a success.

# Help used

To still help myself, I used the following commands for generating some documentation:

## Documentation for the standard library

```bash
rustup doc --std
```

## Documentation for rand

```bash
cargo doc -p rand --open
```
